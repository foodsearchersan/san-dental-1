            <h1>About All-On-4</h1>
            <p>It is estimated that one in five persons worldwide are missing one or more teeth. The significance of a tooth only becomes apparent when it is missing </p>
            <p>In an All-On-4 Implant treatment that essentially involves replacement of all missing teeth in one jaw by using only 4 Titanium implants and fixed artificial teeth. It involves a minor surgery after which the implant is placed and a crown is installed. This procedure gives patients a very natural appearing functional replacement tooth. </p>
            <p>Not every tooth must be lost for this kind of dental implant to be used. Instead, you only need four well corrective implants. For a fully restored smile, they are placed on the top and bottom of your mouth.</p>
            <p>The All-On-4 implants are positioned at an angle to allow us to avoid the jawbone's unhealthy areas. This is done so that bone grafting is not necessary. We also expect this to stably support a prosthesis placed just a few days after the operation.</p>

              <p>When a tooth is lost, its roots are replaced with tiny titanium screws screwed into the jawbone. All-On-4 implants are inserted in a minimally invasive procedure.  The following are the stages in this process:</p>

At Apollo Dental Thoraipakkam, we use Straumann/ Nobel biocare/Adin implants.</div></li>
                <li><TiTick className="on6_div6_li on4_on6_div6_li" /><div>After six to seven months, placing a new bridge is recommended. Acrylic, ceramic, titanium with acrylic or titanium with ceramic are some of the bridge options advised.</div></li>

                      <h2>How do All-On-Four Dental Implants compare to traditional implants?</h2>
                      <p>Unlike standard implants, which use somewhere between 5 and 8 implants in one arch, the All-On-4 treatment only requires 4 implants to replace every tooth on an upper arch. The All-On-4 treatment uses your bone's intrinsic support to boost support through the angled placement of the posterior implants. Traditional implants also frequently need bone grafting, which might take up to 6 months to complete. The All-On-4 Dental protocol requires no bone grafting for most patients, with a success rate that is equal to or better than traditional implants. </p>

                      <p>The All-on-4 procedure is almost painless. The patient will suffer some swelling and pain after the numbness goes away, which will linger for a few days. After their surgery, many patients resume their regular schedules (work, etc.) 1-2 days later. Although they are not in discomfort, they need this time to get used to having their new teeth because it could slightly impair their speech. </p>

Other studies indicate that the identical technique has a 97–98% success rate in the upper jaw. An implant can malfunction on occasion. Knowing this, we carefully evaluate the bone quality and quantity before your procedure and will place six implants if we feel it is a necessary precaution, making our success rate even higher.</p>

All-on-4 dental implants serve as replacement roots that attach to your jawbone in addition to serving as replacement teeth roots.

                      <p>All-on-4 dental implants cannot be removed, The dentist uses tiny screws that only they can undo to attach the prosthesis. All-on-4 restorations are permanent in place as opposed to detachable ones. It can be taken out by the dentist roughly once a year for maintenance, inspection, and expert cleaning.</p>

                      <h2>Who Isn’t a Good Candidate for All-on-4 Dental Implants?</h2>
                      <p>People with underlying illnesses that would make the healing process difficult or extremely slow, as well as those with poor oral health, would not be appropriate candidates for these implants. You might not have the adequate bone density for the implants if you've been missing teeth for a long time. It's possible that you don't have enough gum tissue to support the implants or the associated denture if you have periodontal disease, which causes gum recession.</p>

                      <h2>How will dental implants affect my life?</h2>
                      <p>Replacement teeth supported by dental implants mimic natural teeth in appearance, feel, and functionality. It follows that you are free to eat and drink anything you want. But more crucially, dental implants frequently have a very real impact on quality of life. People who have experienced anxiety and embarrassment due to dental issues are astonished by the positive effects new permanent teeth can have on their self-esteem.</p>

                      <p>You will be restricted to a soft diet for the entire four-month healing period. This enables the implants to stay stationary when they fuse with the bone. There won't be any dietary restrictions once the implants have bonded and the permanent teeth are in position. You'll be able to eat all of your preferred foods once more.</p>

                      <p>You will need to make one or two office visits for the All-on-Four process so that Dentist and/or oral surgeon can design your smile (using a CAT scan, X-rays, impressions, pictures, etc.). Following the first consultations, your operation is to be performed so that your implants and new teeth can be installed all at once (even if tooth extractions are required). You will arrive for surgery with poor (or no) teeth, and you will leave in 2 to 3 days  with a stunning set of fixed, useful teeth.</p>

                      <h2>How are dental implants different from fixed dental bridges?</h2>
                      <p>Dental bridges and All-On-4 implants have numerous similarities. Similar to how bridges use a set of replacement teeth, All-On-4 dental implants use a row of replacement teeth. Fixed dental bridges, however, differ in several important ways. First, unlike All-On-4 dental implants, dental bridges cannot be utilized to replace a complete arch or row of teeth. Dental bridges are typically used to replace one or a few teeth at most.</p>
